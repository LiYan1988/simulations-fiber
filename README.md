# Split Step Fourier Method 

Simulate the propagation of optical pulses in optical fiber with split step Fourier method (SSFM).
The propagation is governed by the nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation (NLSE).
We cannot solve the NLSE analytically and, thus, have to rely on numerical methods as in this repo.
