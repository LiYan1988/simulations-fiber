# Split Step Fourier Method 

Simulate the propagation of optical pulses in optical fiber with split step Fourier method (SSFM).
The propagation is governed by the nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation (NLSE).
We cannot solve the NLSE analytically and, thus, have to rely on numerical methods as in this repo.

### Things to do now
- Simulations with single polarization in multiple-span link
* How to simulate EDFA (add noise)?
* How to simulate CDF? Nonlinearity, dispersion, loss, etc.
* What DSP should be included? Currently chromatic dispersion (D) is compensated, but third order dispersion (S) is not. Should I consider other impairments?
  - $$a=b$$
* For the question above, I guess nonlinearity should not be compensated.
