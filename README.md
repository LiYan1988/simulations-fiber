# Split Step Fourier Method 

Simulate the propagation of optical pulses in optical fiber with split step Fourier method (SSFM).
The propagation is governed by the nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation (NLSE).
We cannot solve the NLSE analytically and, thus, have to rely on numerical methods as in this repo.

### To-do
- Simulations with single polarization in multiple-span link
* How to simulate EDFA (add noise)?
* How to simulate CDF? Nonlinearity, dispersion, loss, etc.
* ~~Currently chromatic dispersion (D) is compensated, but third order dispersion (S) is not. Should I consider other impairments?~~
  - [The lecture notes from the Fiber Optical Communication course in Chalmers](papers/dispersion-lecture-notes.pdf) introduce the dispersion in fiber. 
  - [A document on chromatic dispersion in optical fibers](papers/dispersion-general.pdf) summarizes how to computer third order dispersion coefficient.
* What DSP should be included? I guess nonlinearity should not be compensated.
  - No, only compensate for chromatic dispersion. The resultant constellation diagram of 16QAM is a bit rotated due to __XPM__.
  - Back-propagation to the received signals can generate perfect constellation diagrams for all the WDM channels (including legacy OOK and 16QAM), so the SSF simulation should be correct.
  - In single polarization case, dispersion is enough for my simulations.
